## Changes

* `garden view` doesn't list the expanded path in case it's the same as the Path (if nothing was expanded)


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-tools/garden/releases/download/0.9.3/garden-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/garden
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/garden
```

That's all, you're ready to call `garden`!
